    'About_Me':
      - 'Effective software architecture requires more than technical expertise - it demands an understanding of market
      forces, business strategy, competitive landscapes, and the needs of both users and builders.'
      - 'Hence I am passionate about helping organizations navigate complex socio-technical systems, designing 
      architectures that enable teams to deliver sustainable customer value.'
      - 'With experience in evolving systems through multiple levels of scale, guiding cross-functional teams, and 
      aligning technology with business goals, my focus is on creating systems that are both technically sound and 
      strategically impactful.'

    experience:
      - company: FlixMobility Tech GmbH
        position: Domain Technology Officer (Global Business Excellence)
        start_date: 2024-02
        location: Berlin, Germany
        summary: 'Provided technical leadership to four cross-functional software delivery teams, ensuring alignment 
        with global business and technology strategy while fostering autonomy and innovation.'
        highlights:
          - 'Applied **Wardley Mapping** and **Value Stream Mapping** to re-align organizational and technical 
          boundaries, reducing coordination costs and streamlining integration between teams.'
          - 'Replaced a top-down, push-based alignment process with a bottom-up, pull-based approach using 
          **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** and automated notifications. This freed time for targeted, 
          hands-on coaching with delivery teams.'
          - 'Coached teams in **Evolutionary Architecture** practices grounded in **Continuous Delivery** and 
          **Domain-Driven Design**, using **Ensemble Programming** to instill lasting coding habits. Applied 
          successfully to both greenfield and legacy projects.'
      - company: FlixMobility Tech GmbH
        position: Principal Software Engineer (Process Orchestration)
        start_date: 2021-10
        location: Berlin, Germany
        summary: 'Led the design and development of a new software product to optimize the GoLive process - a critical 
        cross-functional workflow ensuring new bus lines are launched fully equipped and on schedule.'
        highlights:
          - 'Introduced **Quality Storming** (based on the ISO/IEC 25010:2023 quality model), aligning technical and 
          non-technical stakeholders on non-functional requirements and securing shared approval.'
          - 'Defined **Service-Level Objectives (SLOs)** and **Service-Level Indicators (SLIs)** rooted in **Fitness 
          Functions**, enabling continuous validation of system architecture and early detection of degradations in 
          key quality attributes.'
          - 'Implemented a **Kanban** delivery process combined with **Trunk-Based Development** and **Continuous 
          Integration**, significantly improving flow efficiency - reducing lead time, cycle time, and reaction time,
          and enabling faster, more predictable delivery of value.'
          - 'Built software features composed into vertical slices that delivered customer value end-to-end, from the
           user interface through the backend to integrations with other systems.'
      - company: 'SPRK.global'
        position: Head of Development (Food Supply Chain Optimization)
        start_date: 2021-01
        end_date: 2021-10
        location: Berlin, Germany
        summary: 'Built the development function from the ground up: grew the team from zero to a cross-functional 
        unit of 3 developers and a product owner, managed strategic partnerships with software agencies, and prepared
        funding presentations to attract investors.'
        highlights:
          - '**Designed a role description framework and hiring pipeline optimized for candidate experience**, aligning 
          talent acquisition with team composition, skills gaps, and organizational needs. Measured success by 
          throughput and conversion rates at each pipeline stage.'
          - '**Developed an identity and access management (RBAC) system** integrating with all major software tools,
          enabling one-click on- and off-boarding via a public/private key architecture - improving security and 
          reducing onboarding time significantly.'
          - '**Migrated operational workflows from Google Docs to a tailored system** comprising warehouse management, 
          partner management, and supply chain analytics/optimization. Reduced partner integration time by 70% while 
          supporting rapid growth in delivery partnerships.'
      - company: FlixMobility Tech GmbH
        position: Principal Solutions Architect
        start_date: 2018-01

        location: Berlin, Germany
        summary: 'Led the legacy system migration program, defining evidence-based patterns and principles to 
        transform a monolithic system into a [**Self-Contained Systems**](https://scs-architecture.org/) 
        architecture, guided by **strategic Domain-Driven Design**.'

          Storytelling**, establishing the target socio-technical design and executing the transition via a **Reverse
          Conway Maneuver**.'
          - 'Introduced an iterative five-step migration process: strategic classification of bounded contexts 
          (prioritization), boundary alignment (scope), complexity analysis (effort), migration execution (patterns),
          and iteration - enabling structured, evidence-driven modernization.'
          - 'Led multiple migration teams in decomposing legacy components into an **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
          ** built on reactive principles, ensuring low latency, high throughput, and high availability in 
          revenue-critical scenarios.'

      - name: '[The One Question To Haunt Everyone: What is a DDD Aggregate?](https://youtu.be/zlFqjD2LKlE)'
        location: DDD Europe 2022
        summary: >
          There is one question that I am getting asked at almost every conference or meetup: What is and what isn't an
          Aggregate? How do we design an Aggregate? To be honest, it's not an easy answer, even for experienced
          practitioners. In this session I am summarizing the current state of affairs regarding Aggregate design in 
          the Domain-Driven Design community.
      - name: '[Strangling The Monolith: Applied Patterns & Practices From The Trenches](https://youtu.be/cGcrReJ6FbY)'
        location: NDC Oslo 2022
        summary: 'Many developers have been there. A beautifully crafted system that has helped the company grow 
        slowly deteriorates into a big ball of mud. The calls for a rewrite are becoming louder and louder, but these
        big-bang rewrites historically have a high risk of failure. Is there a way to iteratively step out of the mud?'
